USER: Hello
ASSISTANT: Hi there! How can I assist you today?
USER: Could you give me a cake recipe?
ASSISTANT: Sure! Here's a simple recipe for a classic vanilla cake:

Ingredients:
- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups granulated sugar
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup whole milk
- 4 large eggs
- 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
USER: Can I switch baking powder for baking soda?
ASSISTANT: Baking powder and baking soda are both leavening agents, but they are not directly interchangeable. Baking soda is about three times stronger than baking powder and requires an acidic ingredient in the recipe to activate it.

If you want to use baking soda instead of baking powder in this cake recipe, you would need to add an acidic ingredient (such as lemon juice or vinegar) to activate the baking soda. A general rule of thumb is to use about 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda for each
USER: Can I add cherries?
ASSISTANT: Absolutely! Adding cherries to your cake can provide a delightful burst of flavor. Here’s how you can incorporate them into the vanilla cake recipe:

1. Pit and halve or chop about 1 cup of fresh or well-drained canned cherries.
2. If using fresh cherries, you might want to toss them lightly in flour to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the batter during baking.
3. Gently fold the cherries into the batter after it’s fully mixed, just
USER: Thank you very much
