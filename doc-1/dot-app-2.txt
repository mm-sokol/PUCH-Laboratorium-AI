USER: Yes. I'm implementing aa azure openai integration.
ASSISTANT: That's a fantastic integration to work on! Azure OpenAI can significantly enhance your chat console application by providing powerful natural language processing capabilities. Here are a few steps and tips to consider:

1. **Azure Setup**: Make sure you have an Azure account and set up an Azure OpenAI service. You'll need to create a resource group and a OpenAI resource. Obtain the necessary API keys for authentication.

2. **C# Integration**:
   - Use the `HttpClient` class to make requests
